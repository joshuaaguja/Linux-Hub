        <h1>What is a Distro?</h1>
        <p></br>A Linux distribution, often referred to as a "Linux distro," 
          is a complete operating system based on the Linux kernel, which 
          is the core component of the Linux operating system. A Linux 
          distribution includes the Linux kernel, system libraries, 
          system utilities, and additional software applications and 
          components. The purpose of a Linux distribution is to provide 
          users with a fully functional and ready-to-use operating system.
          Each Linux distribution can have its own package management 
          system, configuration tools, and default settings, giving it a 
          unique identity and user experience. Some popular Linux 
          distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS, Arch Linux, 
          and many more. Users can choose a distribution based on their preferences, 
          use case, and level of technical expertise.</p>
